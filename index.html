   <h1>This Office (not that one)</h1>
   <h2>A digital office, with helpful workspace tools</h2>
   <p>Just notes and calendar for now, and the calendar is not even started.</p>
   <p><a href="Notes/index.html">notes</a></p>
   <p>I hope you didn't come here expecting something good, because this is really just for me. I mean, you can use it if you like, but you'll have to bring your own database and self-host.</p>
